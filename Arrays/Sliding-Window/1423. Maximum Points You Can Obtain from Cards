Brute and optimal
1. calculate the sum first from 0 to k-1 ele
2. set that as maxSum for now
3. loop from k-1 to 0th index by decreasing the sum and meanwhile adding from ends and reduxing end to pick the next ele further

class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            sum+= cardPoints[i];
        }
        int maxSum = sum;
        int lsum = sum;
        int rsum = 0;
        int rIdx = n-1;
        for(int i=k-1;i>=0;i--){
            lsum = lsum - cardPoints[i];
            rsum = rsum + cardPoints[rIdx--];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, lsum+rsum);
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
}
